What is Virtual Dom ?
Ans. React uses virtual DOM exists which is like a lightweight copy of the actual dom(a virtual reprentation of the dom). So for every object that exists in the original DOM , there is an object for that in React Virtual DOM . It is exactly the same , but it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document. Manipulating the layout dom is slow , but Manipulating virtual dom is fast as nothing gets drawn on the screen . So each time there is a change in the state of our application , the virtual dom gets updated first instead of the real dom .

HOW virtual dom actually make things faster : When anything new is added to the application , a virtual dom is creted and it is reprented as a tree . Each element in the application is a node in this tree . So , whenever there is a change in the state of any element , a new virtual dom tree is created . This new Virtual dom tree is then compared with the previous virtual dom tree and make a note of the changes . After this , it finds the best possible ways to make these changes to the real DOM . Now only the updated part will get rendered on the page again.
